The user can search for places/restaurants by entering food item( example: pizza or steak), street name( example: rush or state) and/or zip-code. The application then lists relevant restaurants, where they are arranged with respect to ratings from the Yelp database, the user can select nearby Divvy Stations, and can view statistics related to that divvy station like the number of available docks or hourly average of available docks in a Dashboard. The user can also view real-time alerts in a table to show those dock-stations that are more than 90% full or empty in that zip code. And a bar chart to show the number of dock stations that are 90% full or empty, and neither 90% full or empty.
